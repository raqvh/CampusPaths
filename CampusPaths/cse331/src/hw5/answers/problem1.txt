a. For each of the classes below, write the abstraction function and representation invariant, 
   referring to the source code provided in the hw5/problem1 package of your project.
	IntQueue1:
	
	Abstraction Function:
		AF(r) = a queue, q, such that
		q.entries = [n1, n2, ..., n_k] (where n_k = size-1)
		
	Representation Invariant:
		RI(r) = ! (entries.size() < 0 || entries == null)
				  for(entry : entries)
				  	! (entry == null) 
	
	IntQueue2
		Abstraction Function:
			AF(r) = a queue, q, such that
			q.front = front of the queue
			q.size = (front + entries.length -1)
			size = number of elements in the queue.
			q.entries = [n1, n2, ..., n_k] (where n_k = size-1)
		
		Rep Invariant:
			RI(r) = ! (front < 0 || size < 0 || size < front)
					! (entries == null)

b. Equivalent:
		a, d, g
		b, h
		c, f
		e
		
c. 
	public int solveEquations(int x, int y, int z)
		Could expose rep:
			If the integers get stored at all as fields for the class, they may have to be
			> 0 (for example) and would expose the rep.
			If they are simply being used for just this equation, then they should not 
			expose the rep.

	public String[] decode(boolean slowly)
		Could expose rep:
			If the array returned is part of the class, then the client could possibly 
			change things in the array and expose the rep.
		
	private Date myBirthday()
		Could possibly expose rep:
			If Date is not immutable, the client could possibly change information for Date and
			expose the rep.
			If Date is a new object created and has no effect on the class, then it should not
			expose the rep.
	
	public String toString()
		could not expose rep:
			Strings are immutable, so the client can't do anything.
			
	public Iterator<Integer> elements()
		could expose rep:
			If the client is returned an iterator to something important in the class, they could
			possibly change the object and expose the rep.
			
	public Deck(List<Card> cards)
		could expose rep:
			They could give a parameter of cards that is null, assuming it is not allowed.
