# Tests that contains returns true if a node exists in the 
# given graph and false otherwise

# Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Print nodes in graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

# Check contains on existing nodes
graph1 contains n1 is true
graph1 contains n2 is true
	
# Check contains on nonexisting nodes
graph1 contains n4 is false
graph1 contains n5 is false
