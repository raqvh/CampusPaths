# Test that removeEdge properly removed an edge from the graph

# Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print nodes in graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

# Print edges in graph
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1

# Remove an edge in graph
removed edge e1 from graph1

# Print edges in graph
the children of n1 in graph1 are:
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1
