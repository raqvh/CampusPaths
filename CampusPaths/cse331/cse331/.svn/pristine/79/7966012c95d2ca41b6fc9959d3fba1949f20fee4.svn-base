# Tests that size is always correct

# Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Test size on empty graph
size of graph1 is: 0

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Print nodes in graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

# Test size with nodes
size of graph1 is: 3

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 to graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 to graph1

# Print edges in graph
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1

# Test size with nodes and edges
size of graph1 is: 3

# Remove nodes from graph
removed node n3 from graph1

# Print nodes in graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Test size after removing nodes
size of graph1 is: 2

# Clear graph
graph1 was cleared

# Test size after clearing
size of graph1 is: 0
