# Tests that containsEdge properly checks for an edge

# Create an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print edges in graph
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1

# Check contains on existing
contains e1 in graph1 is true
contains e2 in graph1 is true

# Check contain on nonexisting
contains e3 in graph1 if false
contains e4 in graph1 is false
