Changes made to my graph implementation:

	1. Made edge implement comparable, so that my edges could be stored in a treeSet 
	in sorted order. This made accessing the edges in sorted order much easier.

	1. Changed 'get Children' to return edges with the children nodes instead of just 
	the children nodes for output formatting purposes.
