# Tests clear on a graph

# Create graph
created graph graph1

# Add some nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add some edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print nodes
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Print Edges
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1

# Clear graph
graph1 was cleared

# Print nodes
graph1 contains:

# Cannot list edges because the nodes (the keys) were removed.. so there's nothing to map
# to potential values
