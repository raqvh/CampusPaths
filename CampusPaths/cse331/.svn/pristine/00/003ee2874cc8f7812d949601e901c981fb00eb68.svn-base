a.
	Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test? 
		Fibonacci failed this test because it should have only been testing for a
		negative number, but was set to <= to zero, which also threw an exception on zero
		when it shouldn't have.
	What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
		I had to change the exception to only include negatives and not zero case.
b.
	Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? 
		Fibonacci failed testBaseCase because 0 was throwing an exception when it should not
		have been.
	What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
		This issue was fixed when I fixed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test.
c.
	Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test?
		Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase because it needed only to return 1 for the
		0 and 1 case (first two terms in Fib sequence are zero). Also the sum of the subsequent
		terms needed to be added, not subtracted. 
	What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
		I fixed the method to return 1 only if n < 2 instead of n <=2 (that would be three 1's).
		I also fixed the return to add the subsequent values instead of subtract.
