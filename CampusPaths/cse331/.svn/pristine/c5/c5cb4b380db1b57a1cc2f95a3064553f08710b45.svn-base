The Three Pieces: Model, View, Controller

List which parts of my code belong to these different parts.
If a class implements multiple parts, then indicate what methods/lines represent which part.

Model: classes that represent data as well as classes that load, store, look up, or operate on data. 
These classes know nothing about what information is displayed to the user and how it is formatted.
Rather, the model exposes observer methods the view can call to get the information it needs.

View: implements the suer interface. Should store as little data and perform as little computation 
as possible. (Should rely on the model for data storage)

Controller: listens to user input. Based on the user's input, determines the intentions and dispatches
appropriate methods in the model view. (interpretor)
